# Red 7

Some automated exploration of what a game of Red7 actually looks like from a statistical
point of view. The method used here is a pure Monte Carlo simulation, with the players
choosing randomly from the set of their valid moves.

See https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2015-03-30-monte-carlo-red7/ for
an explanation of both the code and the findings.
